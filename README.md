# 🧠 Mental Refocus Game

A fast-paced memory game designed to help refocus the overwhelmed mind. Originally inspired by ADHD coping strategies, this game blends color, shape, sound, and speed to nudge your brain back into the present—one shape at a time.

## 🎮 How It Works

- Shapes in different colors flash rapidly across the screen.
- Your job? Remember the **order of shapes**, not colors.
- After 1 minute, you’re tested on what you saw.
- Get points for each correct shape, in order.
- Progress through 10 increasingly challenging stages.
- Leaderboard keeps track of top performers.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔊 Sound effects (beep, click, success)
- 🎉 Confetti visual reward system
- 🧘‍♀️ Calming immersive topographic background
- 🧠 Shape + color stimulation
- 🏆 Score tracker and mini leaderboard
- 🌐 Deploy-ready React app

## 🎧 Customize Sound

Sound files are in `/public/sounds/`:

Replace them with your own if you'd like a different vibe!
